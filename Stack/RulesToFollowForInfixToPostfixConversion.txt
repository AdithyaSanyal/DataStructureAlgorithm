INFIX TO POSTFIX CONVERSION RULES USING STACK

1. Print Operands as they arrive
2. If stack is empty or contains a left parenthesis,push the incoming operator onto the stack
3. If incoming symbol is '(' push it onto the stack
4. If incoming symbol is ')' pop stack and print operators till left parenthesis is found.
5. If incoming symbol has higher precedence than the top of the stack,push it on the stack.
6. If incoming symbol has lower precedence than the top of the stack,pop and print top.Then test the incoming operator against new top of the stack.
7. If incoming operator has equal precedence with top of the stack,use associativity rule
8. At the end of the expression,pop and print all operators of stack.
=>associativity L to R then pop and print the top of the stack and then push the incoming operator
=>associativity R to L then push the incoming operator
